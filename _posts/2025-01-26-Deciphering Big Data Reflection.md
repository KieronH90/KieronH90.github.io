# Unit 1 Reflection

This introductory unit re-introduced me to the world of big data, its characteristics, and the challenges of managing 
its exponential growth and complexity. I explored methodologies, tools, techniques, and strategies for handling 
big data, specifically focusing on data security requirements. Learning about these challenges and the skills 
needed to develop robust data management systems was initially daunting, but ultimately motivating as I began to 
grasp the potential of big data and the importance of secure data handling.

# Unit 2 reflection

This unit proved a significant learning experience, beginning with the challenge of understanding the breadth of data 
formats. Through systematic exploration of their impact on storage and application, a clearer understanding emerged. 
The study of APIs and their Python integration, while demanding, proved highly rewarding, reinforcing core concepts 
and enhancing comprehension of contemporary data handling practices.

# Unit 3 reflection

This unit included our first collaborative task, which required us to discuss the rationale behind the Internet of 
things (IoT). This task allowed me to explore interesting new ideas along with some of my peers. The details of this 
task are included in the main e-portfolio for this unit. 

It also included a secondary task, based on Web Scraping. This task was perhaps one of the most frustrating tasks that
I have come across during my studies so far, as it is a completely new skill to me. This fact, coupled with the fact that
many major websites have preventative measures in place to prevent web scraping, made this task very difficult to complete.

# Unit 4 reflection

This unit introduced data cleaning and transformation concepts, emphasizing the data management pipeline as a guiding framework. 
I examined factors influencing data cleaning and explored requirements critical for effective data design and process automation. 
Understanding these factors and the pipeline's structure provided a solid foundation for practical data cleaning and 
transformation tasks, including the assessment within this unit.

# Unit 5 reflection

Unit 5's hands-on approach to data cleaning with Python was a steep learning curve. Working with the complex UNICEF data presented 
numerous frustrating obstacles, particularly when trying to master web scraping and efficiently automate cleaning processes. 
While grasping the intricacies of database representation and data models required significant effort and patience, the eventual 
understanding of clear, focused automation made the struggle worthwhile.

# Unit 6 reflection

Unit 6 was probably the most enjoyable of the module so far. Being able to collaborate with my peers to create a piece of work was 
fascinating and engaging. We worked well together, covering the gaps in one another's knowledge, to create what I felt was a well-structured 
and coherent project. I felt that my biggest contributions were both academic, by sourcing research to support our efforts, and logistical 
as my real-life experiences and past employments allowed for a different perspective on the task requirements.

# Unit 7

This unit contained 2 interesting tasks. One on the normalisation of data for better use in databases, and the other to then build a relational 
database using the data obtained in the normalisation task. I felt as though both of these tasks gave me a much more in-depth understanding of databases,
their data and their structure after getting some hands-on experience working with them (however basic).

# Unit 8 reflection

This discussion compared the GDPR's personal data security principle with the UK's ICO standards. Both frameworks prioritize data protection through 
appropriate technical and organizational measures, emphasizing a risk-based approach. The GDPR provides a broad framework, while the ICO offers more 
specific UK guidance. Both acknowledge exemptions for certain processing activities, such as law enforcement or anonymized research data. This 
comparison highlighted the shared goal of secure data handling while recognizing the differing levels of specificity in each framework.

# Unit 9 reflection

This unit's deep dive into Database Management Systems (DBMS) felt initially overwhelming with the sheer variety of conceptsâ€”from relational 
databases like SQL to NoSQL, data warehouses, and Hadoop. However, understanding the design principles and the strengths and limitations of each 
system was incredibly valuable. Learning how database design relates to different programming styles was particularly insightful, making me feel 
much more confident in handling large datasets.

# Unit 10 reflection

This unit explored APIs and their importance in data exchange. While the theory of data parsing and communication was interesting, the real 
learning came from the project. Evaluating API security requirements and developing a mitigation strategy was a challenging but rewarding exercise 
in collaborative problem-solving. It solidified my understanding of real-world API implementation issues.

# Unit 11 reflection

The main body of this week's work was spent completing the executive summary for our project in unit 6. This was an interesting task, that allowed
me to use a lot of the skills that I already use in my daily work as a school teacher: taking complex, technical ideas and explaining them to 
someone with less technical understanding. Exploring the benefits and drawbacks of the decisions we made on our previous project. This was overall,
a very satisfying and rewarding task to complete.

# Unit 12 reflection

Much of this final week has been spent ensuring that both the e-portfolio and reflection tasks have been completed to a standard that I am
happy to share with others publicly. I feel as though I have achieved that goal, and I am very happy with the work I have created and 
submitted throughout the course of this module. 

I am grateful for the skills I have learned and look forward to expanding upon them in the next module.
